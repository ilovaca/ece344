#
# Machine-independent kernel config definitions.
#
# The idea is that the files, options, and facilities in the system
# are declared by conf.kern and the various files it includes. Then
# a kernel config (such as ASST1) is used to select options and 
# facilities for a particular kernel build.
#
# To add new files to the system, you need to edit this file (or
# others like it) and rerun the config script.
#
# Note: when running the config script, be sure to be in the
# right directory (the same one this file is in) and run it as
# "./config", not just "config" - in the latter case you will
# probably get the host system's kernel config utility, which
# will likely make a mess and produce mysterious error messages.
#
# The documentation for the syntax of these files follows.
#

############################################################
#
# Kernel config file syntax:
#
# The syntax for specifying the processor architecture to use is:
#
#    arch archname
#
#       This must come before anything else in the kernel config.
#
#
# The syntax for including the system definition is:
#
#    include conf.kern
#
#       This should come second, after the architecture. This is
#       because the system must be defined before you can do much
#       else useful.
#
#       You can also include other files using the same syntax.
#
#
# The syntax for turning on a kernel compile option is:
#
#    options optname
#
#       A previous "defoption" must have been seen first. See below
#       for more information.
#
#       The act of compiling with debug info is (has to be) handled
#       specially, and is just "debug" without the "options".
#
#
# The syntax for turning on a device driver is:
#
#    device foo%
#    device foo% at bar%
#
#       where the % is either a number or a star, which is treated as
#       a wildcard. The first line enables a device foo that is not
#       supposed to be "attached" to anything. The second line enables
#       a device foo that is attached to a device bar. For more 
#       information about what this means, see below.
#
#
############################################################
#
# Kernel definition file syntax:
#
# Note: All source file names are relative to the top directory of the
# kernel source, that is, src/kern.
# 
# The syntax for adding a regular source file is:
#
#    file sourcefile.c
#
#       Such a file is always included automatically in every kernel.
#
#
# The syntax for defining optional source files is:
#
#    defoption optname
#    optfile optname sourcefile.c
#    optofffile optname sourcefile.c
#
#       "defoption" declares the name of a kernel option. These are
#       then turned on by including "options optname" in a
#       kernel config.
#
#       Source files added with optfile are compiled in if the option
#       specified is enabled. Source files added with optofffile are
#       compiled in if the option specified is not enabled.
#
#       Additionally, a file "opt-optname.h" is created in the compile
#       directory, which defines a C preprocessor symbol OPT_OPTNAME.
#       This symbol is #defined to either 0 or 1 in the logical way.
#       Thus, you can have small bits of code that are enabled or
#       disabled by particular options by writing constructs like
#
#            #include "opt-foo.h"
#            #if OPT_FOO
#               code();
#            #else
#               other_code();
#            #endif
#
#       *** Be sure to use #if and not #ifdef - you want the value
#           of the symbol.
#       *** Be sure to remember to include the header file for the
#           option - if you don't, cpp will silently assume it is 0,
#           which can be quite frustrating.
#
#       The defoption must be seen before any optional file 
#       declarations that use it.
#
#
# The syntax for defining device drivers is:
#
#    defdevice devname                  sourcefile.c
#    defattach devname% otherdevname%   sourcefile.c
#    pseudoattach devname%
#
#       Declare a device driver and its "attachment(s)". (The device
#       driver can then be selectively included or not included in any
#       particular kernel by using the "device" statement in the
#       kernel config file.)
#
#       The specified source files are only compiled if the device
#       is enabled.
#
#       The % is either a specific number N, meaning "only the Nth
#       such device can be attached this way", or a star (*), meaning
#       "any such device can be attached this way".
#
#       In OS/161, device drivers are conceptually organized into
#       trees. This mimics the organization of real hardware, where
#       several expansion cards are plugged into one bus and there
#       might be several devices on each expansion card and so forth.
#
#       There can be any number of these trees. However, devices at
#       the root of each tree must be able to probe and "find"
#       themselves completely on their own. This generally means that
#       they are either all software with no hardware, or they are the
#       system main bus which is located in a machine-dependent way.
#
#       Software-only devices are known as "pseudo-devices". These
#       are "attached" with the pseudoattach directive; functions
#       of the form
#
#           pseudoattach_devname
#
#       are called from autoconf.c to create instances as requested.
#       These calls are made from the function pseudoconfig(), which
#       should be called from dev/init.c after hardware device 
#       initialization completes. The pseudoattach functions should
#       perform all setup and initialization necessary. (No
#       config_devname function will be called.)
#
#       Devices with attachments are automatically probed and 
#       configured from code in autoconf.c. This file is generated
#       by the config script. It contains functions called
#       "autoconf_devname", for each device. These functions call
#       other functions, which are supplied by device drivers,
#       which have the following hardwired names:
#
#           attach_devname1_to_devname2
#
#                 A "devname2" device has been found and configured;
#                 this function attempts to probe the devname2 for
#                 a "devname1" device. Returns NULL if nothing was
#                 found.
#
#           config_devname
#
#                 A "devname" device has been found. This function
#                 can then perform initialization that's shared
#                 among all the possible things it can be attached
#                 to.
#
#       The idea is that there can be multiple attachments for
#       the same device to different underlying devices. In the
#       real world this can be used to great effect when you have,
#       for instance, the same ethernet chipset used on both PCI
#       and ISA cards - the chipset behaves the same way in both
#       cases, but the probe and attach logic is very different.
#
#       The attach_foo_to_bar functions are put in the files
#       specified with defattach; the config_foo function (and
#       generally the rest of the driver for the foo device) is
#       put in the file specified with defdevice.
#
#       One selects particular attachments when including the device
#       in the kernel. A top-level device with no attachments should
#       be included with this syntax:
#
#              device bar
#
#       A pseudo-device should be included with this syntax:
#
#              device bar0
#
#       To make use of device foo, which can be found attached to
#       device bar, one of the following syntaxes is used:
#
#              device foo* at bar*
#              device foo* at bar0
#              device foo0 at bar*
#              device foo0 at bar0
#
#       depending on to what extent you want to configure only a
#       specific device number.
#
#       It sometimes matters what order things are handled in; probes
#       occur more or less in the order things appear in the config,
#       as constrained by the tree structure of the available devices.
#
#       Note that OS/161 does not make extensive use of this 
#       functionality, and the device driver architecture outlined 
#       here is overkill for such a limited environment as System/161.
#       However, it's similar to the way real systems are organized.
#
#
# The syntax for including other config/definition files is:
#
#    include filename
#    archinclude arch-filename
#
#       In the first form, the filename is relative to the top of
#       the kernel source tree.
#
#       In the second form, the arch-filename is relative to the
#       top directory of the architecture-specific area for the
#       selected architecture.
#
#       Thus, if the architecture is "mips", 
#          include conf/conf.foo     includes src/kern/conf/conf.foo
#          archinclude conf/conf.bar includes src/kern/arch/mips/conf/conf.bar
