<h3>Name</h3>
sh - user command shell

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
/bin/sh [-options] [args]

<h3>Description</h3>

How you make this work is entirely up to you. We recommend updating
this page to describe how your shell works once you complete it.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

In large part up to you, though in all probability at least these
system calls will be involved:

<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/execv.html>execv</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/waitpid.html>waitpid</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>

Your shell should function properly once the basic system calls
assignment is complete, although it's certainly ok to include bells
and whistles that won't work until later on.
